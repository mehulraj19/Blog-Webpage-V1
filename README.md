# Blog-Webpage-V1

This the Version1 blogWebPage. This provides all the basic fucntionalities: seeing a blog and composing a blog. 

Here I have used express,locash,body-parser modules for server side and in the client side, I have used ejs templating and css,bootstrap for styling

Implementation of the blog has been done using objects,arrays in js and will surely use database concepts in the next Versions.
